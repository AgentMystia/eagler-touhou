# THPrac and Portable Practice Playbook

Status: active

## Purpose

Guide real semantic THPrac integration and portable practice behavior. Prevent a launch popup, host bypass or UI-only harness from being mistaken for a working Practice lifecycle.

## Applicability and authority

THPrac integration must use a topic worktree separate from upstream tracking
and the canonical Eagler integration worktree. Promotion follows
[Adaptation Worktree Isolation](adaptation-worktrees.md).

- TH06/TH07 reallyportable and source/contract evidence provides the reusable owner, lifecycle and proof method.
- A title without proven THPrac integration must not infer support from another
  title's UI or hook layout.
- Game semantics belong to the target portable/source contract. Shared names such as `State` do not prove shared lifecycle semantics.

<!-- knowledge-id: K-THPRAC-001 -->
## Normal design

The observable path is:

```text
Practice → character/shot → original stage-select position → ImGui/overlay
```

Integration must preserve real ECL hook, section, warp, replay, pause, restart and target semantics. The portable approach replaces DLL injection/D3D/Win32 dependencies with source hooks, a render-independent menu and an adapter; it does not replace game semantics with a host-only mock.

The first hook boundary is after ECL decompression and before pointer tables. Ordinary builds stay unhooked. Use an expected-byte/CRC boundary for the instruction site where the source contract requires it; translated ECL may have a different whole-file CRC policy, but the site check remains.

Track owners separately: live config, original menu memory, adapter/context, host session, Replay candidate, THPrac mode/target and each game's globals. Fresh Practice clears stale owners; `Mode=Original`, `fakeType`, Direct Frame, Chapter, Pause and Replay each retain their own semantics.

Important recorded differences include TH06 Pause-R versus Continue, TH06 time-stop gameplay state, TH07 `mRepStatus`, `THSectionPatch`, `THStageWarp`, reset `State(1)` and navigation states. Do not merge same-named fields across games.

## Purple THPrac shared library

Purple THPrac's title-independent tools belong to `eagler-common`, following
the source-level netplay component model. The optional C++17 target is
`eagler::thprac`; its types live in `eagler::thprac`. The implementation and
source-extraction authority are `eagler-common/docs/thprac.md` and
`eagler-common/tools/generate-purple-thprac.mjs`, not copied title generators.

### Shared and title-owned boundaries

All component paths below are relative to
`eagler-common/include/eagler/thprac/`.

| Shared component | Responsibility / consumer seam |
| --- | --- |
| `PracticeInput.hpp` | Auto-shoot latch, disable-key ordering and fast-retry input tools. The title owns input capture, logical-key conversion and session reset. |
| `PracticeKeyMonitor.hpp` | Native title key masks, 60-frame APS accounting, key recording and CSV. The title owns the monitor instance and authoritative recording cadence. |
| `PracticeSpeed.hpp` | Logical simulation period and Replay speed selection; not Launcher high-refresh presentation. |
| `PracticeKeyHud.inc` | Original purple key-display geometry, colors and drawing order. Bind `key_monitor` to the current session. |
| `PracticeReaction.inc` | Purple reaction test. Supply `PracticeCounter::QuadPart`, `practice_counter_frequency`, `practice_counter_now` and `practice_random_generator` from the platform adapter. |
| `PracticeSpeed.inc` | Purple speed widgets. TH08 supplies its existing reset flag as the optional third argument; preserve other titles' existing UI lifetime. |

Do not move game-specific F12 membership, cheat effects, ECL patches, section /
warp data, completion, Replay ownership, graphics hooks or resources into this
component. `PracticeCadence` remains title-owned: TH08/TH10 and TH11/TH15 have
different catch-up caps. Shared extraction must not erase those differences.
Sharing a tool does not enable it in a title whose original purple F12 menu
does not contain it, and does not imply blue THPrac has been migrated.

### Consumer integration

Include shared headers directly, for example:

```cpp
#include <eagler/thprac/PracticeInput.hpp>
#include <eagler/thprac/PracticeKeyMonitor.hpp>
#include <eagler/thprac/PracticeSpeed.hpp>
```

CMake consumers link `eagler::thprac` (or use
`eagler_common_link_thprac(target)` after including the common CMake helper).
Script-based builds add the common `include/` directory to the compiler search
path. Hash shared `.hpp` and `.inc` inputs into both the object-cache key and
build report; changing common code must invalidate cached title objects.
Do not keep title-local forwarding headers or regenerate private tool copies.

Include UI `.inc` components once in the title's private UI namespace, after
ImGui and required standard-library headers and adapter bindings. Ordinary
builds must not acquire UI/SDL dependencies merely by using the shared header
types. Preserve each title's existing THPrac enable/disable policy.

Localized widgets retain the title's `label(practice_...)` binding. Select its
locale through the existing Launcher language / Runtime THPrac locale contract;
do not add a competing language preference to the shared library. Touch input,
F12 / Tab / Backspace ownership and mobile function buttons also remain on the
existing Launcher-to-Runtime input path; this extraction adds no new protocol.
Retain `THPRAC-LICENSE.txt` (MIT, Ack 2022) when redistributing shared tools.

### Verification and publication

Run these commands from the common repository, with the actual purple source
checkout substituted for `<purple-source>`:

```sh
node tools/generate-purple-thprac.mjs <purple-source> --check
cmake -S . -B build -DEAGLER_COMMON_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

Only the common generator's `--write` updates shared extraction. Title
generators check that authority and regenerate title-specific hooks/resources.
Also run each consumer's source checks, full THPrac build, supported ordinary
OFF build and the lifecycle/device gates below. Source equality and successful
compilation do not prove mobile visual or gameplay equivalence.

For unpublished local validation, explicitly set `EAGLER_COMMON_ROOT` to the
common checkout. Never silently replace an initialized, stale pinned dependency
with a sibling checkout. Publish the common commit first, then register/update
each consumer's `third_party/eagler-common` submodule to that exact published
revision, rerun canonical gates, and publish consumer changes. Do not push a
gitlink to an unpublished commit or ship a release requiring a local override.

Extraction status recorded on 2026-10-10: the shared implementation is
based on common `cedb710`. TH08/TH10/TH11/TH15 consumer changes
are isolated in `experiment/common-purple-thprac` topic worktrees, not promoted
to their daily integration branches. All four full THPrac builds, TH10/TH11/TH15
OFF builds, shared/source checks and 34 common tests passed. TH08 retains its
existing always-built practice adapter. Published experiment consumers pin
common `25d678c` through the Goan114 fork, including TH11's new submodule.
Device validation and promotion to daily integration branches remain pending.
This status is extraction evidence, not a Product Catalog support declaration.

## Invariants and pitfalls

### Mobile group and assisted Replay policy

The mobile Launcher exposes one `作弊和高级设置` button. Its existing
`touch-controls` payload carries `thpracMobilePanelsEnabled` and
`thpracMobilePanelsVisible`; it does not simulate Backspace, F12 or Tab to open
the group. Native windows retain their bodies and title-owned actions, with
collapsed touchable headers supplied by common `PracticeMobilePanels.hpp`.
Key display/tool/result presentation may collapse, but their authoritative
counters and gameplay effects must continue. Desktop keyboard behavior and
window bodies remain unchanged. Missing fields select desktop compatibility.

Allow assisted recordings to use the ordinary Replay save path, as in
TH06–TH08. Preserve the assisted owner and custom Practice metadata; do not
guarantee deterministic playback, inject cheats during playback, or deliberately
corrupt the Replay. Pause save availability and the final serializer must agree.

- UI visibility is not semantic integration proof.
- Vanilla Pause remains the vanilla owner; THPrac must not create a competing Pause layer.
- Retry/restart replaces the old owner and generation; stale `isInReplay` or candidate state must not poison fresh Practice.
- Preserve ECL transaction/range checks and source proof. Do not weaken correctness checks or use hash gates to hide a mismatch.
- Keep proof debt visible. A historical `closed` state can be reopened by a later user report.

## Superseded approaches

Launch popups, UI-only harnesses, host bypasses and fake character state are not Practice integration. A previous proof-closed label is not a permanent guarantee after a later user report.

## Code anchors

- `integrations/RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md`: shared Host/Runtime integration boundary.
- The target title's Practice lifecycle, ECL/resource owners and THPrac adapter:
  title-specific semantic authority.
- the sibling TH06/TH07 Runtime practice owners and, when available in a full
  maintainer workspace, the external `thprac-reallyportable` reference project.
  These are reference sources, not files shipped inside this repository.

## Verification

For TH06/TH07 Emscripten releases, `TH_EXTERNAL_ASSETS=ON` is a source-only
build, not a deployable Launcher Runtime. It omits `loadPackage` and cannot
mount the Launcher-provided DATA even though WASM and the Launcher boot.
Build with `TH_EXTERNAL_ASSETS=OFF`, `TH_WEB_MUSIC=BASE`, and the existing
shared-font policy. Keep original assets private/local; do not publish them
as part of a code-only repair. Before freezing a Runtime generation, use
`lib/runtime-data-layout.mjs::extractGameDataLayout` to match the published
DATA layout and byte count, and verify the generated DATA hash against the
unchanged package. Reject missing preload metadata, rather than bypassing it.
Verify both titles through the real managed-DATA Launcher path: native archives
and shared fonts mounted, no startup alert, title menu rendered, and a normal
run entered. Launcher-only boot and a harness that manually installs individual
archive files do not prove that production DATA preloading works.

1. Verify the hook/source boundary and ordinary-build OFF behavior.
2. Enter fresh Practice, select character/shot, reach original stage-select and open the real overlay.
3. Exercise section/warp, Pause, Replay, restart/retry, target completion and exit/re-entry.
4. Check owner/reset/mutation closure and compare logic-first evidence, not only UI screenshots.
5. Label source contract, automated lifecycle, browser and human/device evidence separately.

## Deliberately omitted claims

This playbook does not promote a visible Practice menu to proof of real ECL,
Replay, pause/restart or target semantics.
